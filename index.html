      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a Graphic Designer wanting to explore more ways to be creative and create interactive, responsive web sites</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally I was born in Colombia, I moved to the United States in 2003 for better oportunities in life. I live in the city of Chicago with my beautiful small family, my wife and my son</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing and spending time with my son and family, listening to music, playing soccer, running and traveling.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is where I feel I enjoy what I do and motivates me to start my day, a job that pushes me to be a better father, husband and son. A job where I can feel I have a secured future with good benefits. A job I can teach my son and introduce him into technology.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In the great city of Chicago.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ever since I started my schooling I wanted to get into web design, my full time job at that time didn't allow me to attend the classes held in the morning. Web developing is fun, is the future and it's a evolving carreer.</p>
